- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

There are no log files! None! We only have the parsed json from the form. 

We add logs in the secure version using a middleware function. 

We can make this stronger by adding strong access controls to the logs.
