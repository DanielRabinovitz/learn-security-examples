- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

The vulnerability is that the use can directly pass in an id input that can crash the server by triggering an error. The secure version uses a try/catch block to keep the server from crashing on an error related to the id. 

A way to prevent this better is to have an error handler that informs of the user of an invalid input while preventing the input from reaching the backend.
